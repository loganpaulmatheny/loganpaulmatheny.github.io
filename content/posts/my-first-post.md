I've been wanting to start a blog for awhile, it's been one of my goals. Unfortunately, there are quite a few other goals I haven't seemed to be able to make much progress on in the last year or so. From loosing 10 lbs, coding every day, to building a camp kitchen for my car. All of my goals remain somewhat in-progress or potentially further away than when I started (in the case of my weight). So what gives?

There are a lot of things I might lay blame or point to reasons why it's been hard to accomplish my goals or institute habits. Note - I'll be referring to habits and goals interchangeably. We had our son in February, and my fiances recovery was somewhat challenging. I finished my coding bootcamp earlier in the year. Or perhaps I am just still 'chilling out' after my time in the Army. Or perhaps there's something more fundamental about why I've been unsuccessful thus far.

Enter James Clear and his immensely popular book, <u>Atomic Habits</u>. I'd started reading the book numerous times in the past, but never seemed to finish it. I remember thinking that a lot of the information in the book felt common sense. Well this time, something clicked. I re-read his observation that habits are so powerful because of their power to compound, like compounding interest in investing, and another article on creating creative work. The potential culprit stood out to me like the butter croissant sitting next to the food scale in my kitchen.

## The Helsinki Bus Station: Accumulating goal capital

In Jamees' article entitled, [The Proven Path to Doing Unique and Meaningful Work](https://jamesclear.com/stay-on-the-bus), he recounts a graduation speech given by Arno Rafael Minkkinen, in which he gave advice to students on how to produce quality creative work over a career. Arno's uses a metaphor for a career centered on the Helsinki Bus Station (he's a Finn). He suggests to the students that many artists will get on a bus route, representing perhaps a defining medium or direction for their career, and start traveling past stops, each representing a year's worth of work. They'll stay on the bus for maybe three stops and suddenly, when they receive a modicum of success, get off and head back to the station to try a different route that seems more promising or perhaps represents a new trend in the art world.

His advice is simple, "don't get off the fucking bus." Arno suggests that by instead staying on the bus, a young artist can continue to developing their skills and eventually re-work some of their early ideas - leading to true original work. I believe this is where Clear's metaphor that habits can have compounding effects ties in nicely with Arno's.

Achieving goals is similar to the Helsinki bus station vignette because having too many dilutes our ability to make progress in any one area. I say dilute, but I think kills is a more apt term based on my experience. I'm a habitual planner of projects, organizer of life areas, you name your system for trying to keep all the to dos and wishes of life in order and on track and I've tried it. This is the problem.

Similar to Arno's observation, that the interesting work happens when an artist doesn't jump from one new medium or project to another - it comes when they have mastered a craft and can look back at earlier work and re-interpret it. I believe choosing and working towards a solitary goal is similar. There are chief benefits to accomplishing but one goal at a time.

1. Going through a process of learning and struggle towards mastery or completion strengthens you body and mind do it again in the future. Much like lifting weights or reading challenging texts.
2. The process of completing a goal will likely create connections with others along the way, allowing you to leverage those connections with others in the future to avoid common pitfalls of your next goal.
3. Capital via relationships, knowledge, or skill accrued during the accomplishment of your goal can be immediately implemented towards the accomplishment of the next one, rather than starting over from scratch.

These three benefits are what I call 'goal capital.' They are intangible assets that allow you to get off at a given bus stop on your life journey, but instead of heading all the way back to the main station, change busses and continue on the next route. The problem is not getting on a different bus when arrive at a satisfactory stop, it's that starting all over back at the beginning each and every time you change goals rather than utilizing your new knowledge, skill, or habit means you're not progressing on your life's journey. How much sense does it make to have a destination in mind, but keep pulling the emergency stop after a few feet on the bus and walking back to the main station to try a different line.

## Goal Monogamy: A committed relationship with one goal makes for a better life

So how can take advantage of goal capital and use it to not only steadily accomplish our goals, but actually increase the rate at which we can achieve them? I believe the best way to ensure you have the best chance of success in accomplishing your goals is to become 'goal monogamous.'

Call me old fashioned, but I think there are few people who would advocate for having only one goal in today's modern era. There are probably thousands of books extolling the virtues of dreaming big, keeping all your areas of life moving at 100mph, and telling you that you can do it all if you just have the right 'system'. But just as I mentioned in my difficulty making my way through James' book because it was just 'common sense.' Well, the truth hurts, common sense is not common practice and no system is going to allow you to consistently help you keep all your goals moving along steadily at the same time.

You need to build the momentum and exponential gains that come from the accrual of goal capital, and having a strong monogamous relationship with one goal or habit at a time will do that. By focusing on only one thing at a time say loosing weight, you can focus your energies to just worrying about that amidst all the other pressures of life. Your job, sure you'll keep meeting the demands handed down by your boss. The kids, awesome now you don't have to stress about being a 'good' parent - you can just enjoy that time with them. Honestly it'll probably make you a better parent in the long run. Having one distinct focus will allow you do achieve the most important thing when it comes to goals or habits - you'll see progress. Undeniable, unbelievable, and beautiful progress.

Now there are many reasons why this knowledge and practice are not common place and certainly not easily implemented (I'll even be writing about some of those in the future), but rest assured picking one thing and go after it with all your effort, it's the quickest and maybe only way to achieve desired results for us mere mortals. Stay on the bus and when you get to your desired stop, grab a cup of coffee or celebrate however you choose, and get on the next bus to your new destination. Don't head back to the damn station - ever.
