      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to start a blog for awhile, it&amp;rsquo;s been one of my goals.

From loosing 10 lbs, coding every day, to building a camp kitchen for my car. All of my goals remain somewhat in-progress or potentially further away than when I started (in the case of my weight).</description>
